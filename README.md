# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction
🏥 Medical Insurance Cost Predictor
This project is a Machine Learning–based Medical Insurance Cost Prediction Web Application built using Python, Scikit-Learn, and Flask. The application predicts an estimated medical insurance cost based on user-provided details such as age, BMI, gender, smoking status, number of children, and region.
A trained Scikit-Learn Pipeline model (saved as a .pkl file) is used to handle data preprocessing and prediction seamlessly. The model is integrated into a Flask backend, while a simple and user-friendly HTML interface allows users to input their details and view the predicted insurance cost in real time.
